1-In input and output parameters in Function definition, size of String and Matrix is taken to be maximum possible so as to define offset.
2-Matrix and String offset is defined only when it encounters an initialisation statement.
Exception is when Matrix and String are in Function CAll statement, in which case they are initialised to the maximum value
3- If a function call is invalid
4- If LHS of a matrix is not initialized, then consistency of RHS is not even checked.
5- If RHS of Arithmetic expression is not declared, it gives type mismatch error also.
6- Check predictive parser table for arithmetic expression
